Do you remember...

when we had it all?

6
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,746
Do you dream...

7
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,126
of when we had to leave?

8
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,530
When you led us out...

9
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,163
and how it all began.

Our story starts beside a water hole
that was filled by the storm.

[elephant trumpets]

17
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:56,778
Among the great herds here
are the world's last giant tuskers,

18
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:04,036
descendants of a noble lineage
that once stretched across Africa.

19
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,165
[loud rumbling]

20
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,638
Queen of them all is Athena.

21
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,935
[baby squawking]

22
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,611
She is a 50-year-old matriarch,
head of her extended family.

23
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,033
Like most of us, she has neighbors.

24
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,661
And this is their story too.

25
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,087
Her family is made up
of female relatives and their calves.

26
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:13,897
They are so close that the youngsters
might as well be brothers and sisters.

27
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,492
Athena's family rely
on her experience and wisdom,

28
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,496
for she makes the decisions
that determine their survival.

29
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,170
Her most recent daughter, Princess,
is a year old,

30
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,589
and calm like her mother.

[squawking]

32
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,387
Then there's Wewe,

33
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,514
the herd's naughty boy.

34
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,653
He's always trying
to make friends with Princess.

35
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:07,075
But he tries too hard,
and often it just gets him into trouble.

36

[Wewe squeaks]

38
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,258
As a boy, Wewe will stay
with the family until he's a teenager

39
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:27,179
and then leave home
to join an all-male herd.

40
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,768
Mimi is the family's newest arrival.

41
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,937
She was born in the storm.

42
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,401
It's day one for her
on a lifetime of learning.

43
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,831
For the next two years, she'll be
totally dependent on her mother's milk.

44
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:04,216
Her mother, Mala,
gives birth only once in five years,

45
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,094
which makes every calf precious.

46
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,060
While Mala might be the one who feeds her,

47
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,855
Mimi will be cherished by them all,

48
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,066
for it takes a herd
to raise an elephant calf.

49
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,953
[man singing]

50
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,251
This is Athena's kingdom.

51
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,504
For now, it has everything they need.

52
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,511
Every day she brings her family
to the main water hole,

53
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,307
which can be a nuisance for her neighbors.

54
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,145
But they need the elephants

55
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,650
'cause they made the water hole
and now keep it open.

56
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:17,664
But for bullfrog, it can feel
like the construction never ends.

57
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:36,058
Most of the family's neighbors
live at elephant toenail height.

58
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:45,025
In one way or another,
they all depend on their giant friends.

59
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,030
[man singing]

60
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,705
The water hole is home to them all.

61
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,500
But from the moment the sun comes out...

62
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,876
[croaks]

63
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,169
...it starts to shrink.

64
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,256
So the race is on to raise their families.

65
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,261
Bullfrog is on it immediately,

66
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,305
and there will be tadpoles in no time.

67
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,897
Beneath them,
the killifish have no way of knowing

68
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,150
how or when
Athena's family will help them.

69
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,154
For now,
they have eyes only for each other.

70
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:40,038
Each time the male hugs the female,
she lays an egg...

71
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,125
and then buries it.

72
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,981
With nightfall, Athena knows
she has to be especially vigilant.

73
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:11,195
So her family will sleep on their feet
to better protect Wewe and Mimi.

74
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,701
[elephants rumble]

[croaking]

76
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,041
But for some of their neighbors...

77
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,670
the party is just getting going.

00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,965
[croaking, chirping]

79
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:50,192
If you're a female foam frog,
a single partner is simply not enough.

80
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,904
She invites a whole crowd to a foam party.

81
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,329
It's the first event of the season
at Athena's water hole.

82
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,253
She'll lay her eggs
in the froth whipped up by the males,

83
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,256
and they will develop safely inside.

84
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:25,269
Up above,
an Egyptian goose is a step ahead.

85
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,438
[chirping]

86
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,691
She laid her eggs a few weeks ago.

87
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,074
It will be two months
before her chicks are ready to fly.

88
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,663
Until then,
the water hole will be their home.

89
00:11:55,757 --> 00:12:00,012
[squawking]

90
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:06,310
With Mimi so young,
Athena won't move far from the water.

91
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:12,232
She's always cautious until a newborn
starts to put on weight and gets stronger.

92
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,488
It's the first time
Wewe has met someone younger,

93
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,533
and he's doing his best to make friends.

94
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,589
[loud chirping]

95
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,850
While some are getting started
with their nests,

96
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,977
others are finishing up.

97
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,189
It's been a long night for the foam frogs,

98
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,858
and they're beginning to tire.

99
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,075
But for one reveler,
at least there's a taxi ride home.

100
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,218
Sometimes,
a foam frog gets taken for a ride

101
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,970
whether he wants it or not.

102
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,498
The foam frog is happy
to sit out in the sun.

103
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,794
But it can burn a baby's skin,

104
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,673
so Wewe shows Mimi
where best to find shade.

105
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,272
While the living is easy,

106
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,817
Athena can relax
and allow the babies to rest.

107
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,865
But Wewe never goes down for long.

108
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,826
He's excited by Mimi's arrival

109
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,746
and would rather try
and wake his new friend to play.

110
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,214
Mimi must rest while she can.

111
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,260
She needs to get strong
so she can keep up with her family.

112
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,394
[honking]

113
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:58,190
Mother Goose wants to get her chicks
to the safety of the water hole.

114
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,319
It's day one for them too.

115
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,073
And after a tiring night,
they are in no hurry.

116
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:15,249
Besides, what she's proposing
requires a huge leap of faith.

117
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,376
[honking]

[honking continues]

They've a conflict of instinct

between wanting to stay together
and joining their parents.

[geese honking]

123
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,809
It takes just a flyby to convince them

124
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,898
that their best chance of surviving
is to stick close to Mum and Dad.

125
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,491
In any family,
there is always one who is last and late.

126
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,619
We'll call him Stephen.

127
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,998
The parents rely
on their young keeping up with them,

128
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,001
so they don't know
that Stephen's left behind.

[squealing]

132
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:49,319
Just occasionally,
last and late is also lucky.

133
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,830
Athena's knowledge of the kingdom

134
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,500
has been handed down
from mother to daughter over centuries.

135

[elephant trumpets]

136
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,422
Her tusks are the largest
of any matriarch.

137
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,890
The notch comes
from years of snagging grass and vines.

138
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,111
The vines she likes most
flower for just a few days each year.

139
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,572
And she knows just where to find them.

140
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,536
The prospect of a feast
distracts the family

141
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,538
from what's happening at toenail height,

142
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,958
so it's up to her neighbors
to get out of the way.

143
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:00,307
Chameleon relies
on her camouflage for protection.

144
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,781
But there are times
when choosing to stay still and blend in

145
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,408
is the worst decision to make.

146
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,963
She's probably as close to panic...

147
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,217
as a chameleon ever comes.

148
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,290
For Athena's family,

149
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,877
life at home in the green season
acquires a gentle rhythm.

150
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,505
She'll let them eat until it warms up

151
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,924
and then lead them down for a drink.

152
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,141
It's been only four days since the storm,

153
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,187
but the foam frogs' nests
have baked in the sun.

154
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,105
And they are ready.

155
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:54,254
For the next few weeks, the water hole
will be home to the frogs' tiny tadpoles.

156
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,596
As they hatch,
they'll go unnoticed by Athena's family,

157
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,517
but they won't go unnoticed

158
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,353
by the killifish and terrapins
living beneath them.

159
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,619
Only the largest terrapin can reach them.

160
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:40,467
His prize is a meringue

[elephant trumpets]

162
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,584
It's Mimi's first time in the water.

163
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,086
So she starts at the shallow end,

164
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,881
and she needs no encouragement.

165
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:31,101
For Athena's family, this is paradise.

166
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,069
But unless it rains again,
the water holes will vanish within weeks.

167
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:49,161
If that happens, Athena knows
they'll be forced out of the kingdom.

168
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:53,332
So they must make the most
of this time of plenty.

Princess learns what to eat
by copying her mum.

170

But the babies are still on milk,

171
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:13,227
which gives Wewe time
to brush up on his foot-and-trunk skills.

But it will be months
before he achieves this level of control.

173
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:35,040
Athena is aware
that there is a dry season coming.

174
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,710
And the only way to prepare for it
is to put on weight.

175
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,713
It means piling it in.

176
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:50,180
But what goes in... must come out.

177

it is a gift from the gods.

The message has traveled far and wide.

And with others homing in,

182
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,993
there's no time for a leisurely lunch.

183
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:57,789
He needs to ball it up and roll it away
as quickly as possible,

soft enough to bury his ball

so he can feed in peace.

Besides feeding dung beetles,

197
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:19,371
Athena's family provides the kingdom
with a free gardening service.

198

Most of the seeds they eat
pass through them undigested,

to be planted in neat balls of compost

Tortoise is waiting for someone.

the geese need to keep a safe distance.

But with the water level dropping

For tortoise, life is looking up.

A female has come down to drink.

00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,673
He can intercept her easily enough.

226
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:21,386
But to impress her, he has to prove
he has stamina equal to her own.

227
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,682
And that means going for a walk.

From being last and late,

Stephen has progressed
to being lost and lucky.

237
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:13,040
Some of Athena's neighbors drop by
only when the grasslands start to dry

238
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,666
and food is on offer.

239
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:20,881
The bee-eaters join Athena's family
for just a few days,

240
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,593
when the kingdom's grasshoppers
are at their juiciest.

241
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,597
They rely on the family to flush them out.

242
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:57,251
The bee-eaters' friendship will last
just as long as there are grasshoppers.

243
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:04,758
As soon as they're finished,
the birds will move on.

Stephen is as excited about grasshoppers
as anyone.

He might lack ability, but not ambition.

246

Down at toenail height,
dung beetle is still on a mission.

247
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,332
He might look
like he's pushing his ball forwards,

248
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:41,086
but he's actually upside down,
dribbling it backwards.

249
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:46,466
He can't see where he's going,
but that doesn't bother him.

250
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:52,014
His determination
is out of all proportion to his size.

251
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:57,060
Now that he's got the ball,
he just hates to let go of it...

but they have kicked the ball out of play,

259
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,788
which allows dung beetle
to regain possession.

Whenever the terrapins hear them coming,
they make themselves scarce.

But the storm was weeks ago,

265
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,547

The water hole has been his entire world.

But with so little water left,
his time is almost over.

With the pool party getting rowdy,

271
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,338
they all risk getting squashed.

Elephants live tactile lives.

277
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:16,927
They use their sensitive trunks and feet
to explore anything new.

There's no malice here, just curiosity.

In elephant society, aggression is rare...

even between bulls

when they join Athena's family
at the kingdom's salt lick.

282

Instead, there's a greeting,

a quiet acknowledgement of status...

284
00:36:58,135 --> 00:36:59,303
and then sharing.

Mining the salt-rich soil takes practice.

286
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:32,961
It's about foot-and-trunk coordination
and then breath control.

Mimi always seems to be hungry,

yet she never suckles for long.

298
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:43,782
It's the only time her big sister, Milly,
gets involved

299
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,994
and tries to keep Wewe away.

300
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,917
For Mala is not producing much milk...

301
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,964
and Mimi needs every mouthful she can get.

302
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:18,650
At the end of each day, everyone is tired.

303

Mother Goose has no way of knowing
that Stephen is still missing.

Throughout the kingdom, most
of the water holes have already dried,

and Athena is getting restless.

She knows now
that they will have to leave,

but she's concerned that Mimi might not
be strong enough to make the journey.

She seems to get hung up in situations

that most babies
would take in their stride.

310
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:40,816
For her friends, it's difficult to know
whether she's in trouble

311
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,484
or just very tired.

[low rumbling]

But when Athena rumbles, "Move on,"

314
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,833
everyone has to fall in line.

315
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:04,631
And for a baby elephant,
there is nothing worse

316
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:07,176
than the prospect of being left behind.

[squawking]

It's not just Athena who feels
the approach of a time of change.

Almost overnight,
bullfrog's new family have grown legs

00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:36,747
and are now driven to leave the water
to start a life on land.

321
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:47,674
Luckily for them,
their new bones are still very soft.

[elephant rumbles]

324
00:42:14,076 --> 00:42:17,538
But they'd rather not push their luck
with three tons of elephant.

325
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:52,739
Athena hasn't set off
for their dry-season refuge yet

326
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,701
because Mimi is struggling.

327
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,543
She needs her mother's encouragement.

328
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:33,363
With the dry season setting in,
there's no going back.

329
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:38,535
But just occasionally, nature smiles

330
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,038
and gives back what she took away.

[chirping]

332
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:14,029
Hopefully, Stephen's night alone

333
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:17,324
has shown him
just how much he needs his family.

334
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:28,126
The last froglets
are now ready to come ashore.

335
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:32,464
But those that emerged first are bigger,

336
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:34,633
and they are waiting.

337
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,144
[grunting]

338
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,202
For a bullfrog
to get the best start in life,

339
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,249
it helps to have a big mouth
and small relatives.

340
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:25,684
In the kingdom,
weeks without rain have taken their toll.

341
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,812
But if Athena was ever
in doubt about what's coming,

342
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:31,940
the arrival
of the great flocks confirms it.

343
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:57,549
As the lands around dry,
quelea are forced to migrate.

344
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:20,822
Their whirlwind arrival
can be overwhelming.

345
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:33,001
And they'll drink in a day
what Athena's family drinks in a week.

346
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:43,887
[trumpeting]

347
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:06,201
By the time they move on,
they've drunk the water hole dry.

348
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,877
[trumpets]

349
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,966
Athena's family
will use the mud as sunscreen.

350
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:24,011
And this is vital for the killifish,

351
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:27,306
for they left their eggs
hidden in the mud.

352
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:33,979
They developed into tiny fish,
but never hatched.

353
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,733
They can survive out of water for weeks.

354
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,069
So when Athena's family move on,

355
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:43,780
they will carry tiny passengers with them.

356
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:52,539
In this way, the killifish babies
get to move between water holes

357
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:54,499
by riding on elephants.

[squeaking]

359

Athena knows she should have left by now,

360
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:21,360
but the nearest permanent water
is almost 100 miles away.

361
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:27,366
And she delayed
in the hope that Mimi would get stronger.

362
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:37,084
Mala is now so protective
that even Wewe is no longer welcome.

[squawks]

364
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:46,134
Mimi's big sister, Milly,
can give her comfort

365
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:49,137
but not the milk she so desperately needs.

366
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:56,103
Only time will tell whether Athena's
decision to delay was the right one.

367
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:00,649
She now has no choice.

368
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,360
The kingdom is without water,

369
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:06,655
and ahead of them the pools are drying.

370
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,450
They must head for the refuge.

371
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:51,575
Mala and Milly now work together.

372
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:38,580
However much Athena might want to,

373
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:43,961
as matriarch, she cannot put Mimi's needs
above those of the whole family.

374
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,956
While Mala and Mimi head down to drink,

375
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,959
Athena will take the others to feed,

376
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,045
for she must try
to balance everyone's needs.

[squawks]

378
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:26,021
Mimi's desperation to drink can only mean
that Mala's milk has dried up.

379
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:28,774
But Mala can't know that.

380
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:33,445
She knows that a weak calf
can easily become trapped in mud,

381
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,824
and her instinct is to do
everything she can to keep Mimi away.

[squeals]

383
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:25,956
Mimi is not yet weaned.

384
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:28,500
So if she's not been getting milk,

385
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:30,752
she's not been getting food.

386
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:06,413
There are times when a mother
needs her daughter's support.

It's what family is for.

The next day, it is hotter,

and Athena's predicament, even worse.

392
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:16,149
She doesn't want to leave Mimi behind,

393
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:19,069
but neither can she
put her entire family at risk.

394

Athena knows
that they've reached the last pool.

And today it will dry.

A terrapin senses it too and will dig deep
into the mud while he can.

00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:50,309
He'd rather risk being stepped on
than caught out by the dry season.

00:56:03,238 --> 00:56:05,365
Mala will never give up.

Sometimes, however sad,
there is release in death.

Athena knows
she cannot afford another delay.

It will take three days
to reach the dry-season refuge.

410
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:48,106
And she has left it so late

that there is nowhere
they can drink on the way.

There is no time to stop and comfort Wewe.

Behind them, where there was a water hole,

is now the soft ground
that dung beetle's been looking for.

They, too, will head for the refuge...

following the same paths as the elephants.

422
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:51,563
Every day,
Athena stops briefly so they can feed.

423
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:57,528
They are kinder to Wewe now.

01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:00,280
Even Princess is more tolerant.

425
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:17,506
Milly has no milk to give,

426
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:20,759
but Wewe's suckling
will comfort them both.

01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:43,031
Athena's route out of the kingdom
is a mind map of elephant paths

that she learned from her mother
and has never forgotten.

429
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:55,711
There are badlands to cross.

But they don't walk alone.

01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:08,325
All are heading for the refuge.

432
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:38,063
The refuge is a water hole
fed from underground.

Even at the height of the dry season,
there is water for all.

Athena comes here
only in the driest years.

It is the one occasion
that her status as monarch is equaled.

This is Satao, king of them all.

A tusker of mythical proportions.

He is a gentle giant...

to whom all defer.

He's been out in the wilderness all year

01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:22,203
and will use this occasion to see
if any female is in season.

Nusu is a young female
from Athena's family.

01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:39,763
But she's heavily pregnant.

[trumpets]

For the first time since Mimi died,
Wewe enjoys himself.

453
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:10,836
It's a chance for him
to meet calves from other families.

454
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:23,056
And when he's exhausted from playing,
there's always his family to help out.

455
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:46,413
As the dry season progresses,
food at the refuge becomes scarce.

456
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:56,507
So each evening, Athena's family
must travel further to feed.

457
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:23,909
After every journey out,
they must all come back to water.

01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:39,675
It is their lifeline.

459
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:43,136
But it ties them to the refuge,

460
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,347
and the knot is slowly tightening.

461
01:11:55,148 --> 01:11:58,902
They have little energy,
for almost everything has been eaten.

What started out as a refuge
has gradually turned into a prison.

When the rains don't arrive,

what began as a dry season
turns into a drought.

01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,639
And the consequences
and casualties start to build.

Athena dares not leave,

468
01:12:57,211 --> 01:13:00,130
for there is no other water
within walking distance.

469
01:13:17,981 --> 01:13:23,028
In such a drought,
what kills is not thirst but starvation.

470
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:31,036
For them all, it is only a matter of time.

In her 50 years, Athena has never
experienced a drought so bad.

473
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:21,420
The decision she now has to make
has never been more critical.

474
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:34,975
This time, the lives of her entire family
are at stake.

475
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:39,271
If she stays, they will starve.

01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:42,608
But if she leaves and times it wrong,

01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:44,985
they will all die of thirst.

478
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:54,369
Whatever the outcome,
the responsibility is hers alone.

479
01:15:13,096 --> 01:15:14,598
Such is their faith in her,

480
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:19,811
that when she decides to head
back to the kingdom, no one hesitates.

481
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:27,986
For she is their matriarch.

482
01:15:29,613 --> 01:15:31,281
They would follow her anywhere.

483
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:37,287
[vocalizing singing]

484
01:16:21,498 --> 01:16:24,543
Back in her kingdom, it is no better.

485
01:16:54,531 --> 01:17:00,704
Where the water hole was, those
that dug down are alive but entombed,

486
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:07,294
trapped in a state of suspended animation.

487
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,476
For them all, for the spell to be broken,

488
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:24,686
it must rain.

489
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:44,873
Out in the badlands,

490
01:17:45,499 --> 01:17:48,335
the family do their best
to protect Wewe from the sun.

491
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:06,395
But he has to walk two steps to their one.

492
01:18:12,526 --> 01:18:14,444
And that takes its toll.

493
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:55,444
When Athena finally stops,

494
01:18:56,361 --> 01:19:01,074
it's not to look for food
but to remember one of their own.

495
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:30,771
For a few moments,
the drought is forgotten

496
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:34,441
as they join in an understanding
of what was

497
01:19:35,734 --> 01:19:38,570
and what it means to be one of their kind.

498
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:15,691
Where they are heading
is still gripped by the drought.

499
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:53,270
[rumbles]

500
01:21:08,285 --> 01:21:10,704
With the kingdom just a day's walk away,

501
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:15,042
there is only one thing
that could cause Athena to stop.

502
01:21:24,843 --> 01:21:27,471
After carrying her baby
for almost two years,

503
01:21:29,056 --> 01:21:30,724
Nusu has given birth.

504
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:34,603
[grunting]

505
01:21:35,646 --> 01:21:37,314
Her baby is a girl.

506
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:47,491
She knows nothing
of what she's been born into.

507
01:21:50,536 --> 01:21:53,163
Her priority is to find her first meal.

508
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:06,218
As ever, Wewe is eager to make friends.

509
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:15,894
[squeals]

510
01:22:44,715 --> 01:22:47,342
It would seem the worst time to be born.

511
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,349
But Athena knows differently.

512
01:22:57,269 --> 01:23:01,190
For thousands of years, her kind were
thought to be able to summon the rain.

513
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:07,237
The truth is
that she could sense rain coming

514
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:09,406
when it was over 100 miles away.

515
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:12,326
[thunder rumbling]

516
01:23:39,686 --> 01:23:43,065
There is only one way
to rebalance the kingdom.

517
01:24:26,275 --> 01:24:29,862
[squawking, squealing]

518
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:39,538
It's been a year
since they saw water flow,

519
01:24:40,038 --> 01:24:41,415
and it comes as a shock.

520
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:47,713
[trumpeting]

521
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:51,884
[chorus vocalizing]

522
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:09,735
In Africa, to be born on the cusp
of the rains is a sign of good fortune.

523
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:14,990
For rain is always cause for celebration.

524
01:25:15,073 --> 01:25:17,201
[trumpeting]

525
01:25:42,434 --> 01:25:44,728
[trumpeting]

526
01:25:57,241 --> 01:26:01,912
Once again, the elephant paths
will channel water to fill water holes.

527
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:13,674
[birds calling]

528
01:26:17,177 --> 01:26:19,972
Underground, the rain is a wake-up call.

529
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:19,781
[trumpeting]

530
01:27:43,555 --> 01:27:46,934
[squawking]

531
01:28:03,617 --> 01:28:06,703
Just as every smile
leaves its impression on a face,

532
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:11,124
so every journey
leaves its imprint on this continent.

533
01:28:18,131 --> 01:28:20,259
The young geese
are still a tight-knit group.

534
01:28:21,301 --> 01:28:24,513
But it won't be long before they start
to look for mates of their own.

535
01:28:38,402 --> 01:28:42,739
And true to form,
Stephen is last and late.

536
01:29:04,303 --> 01:29:07,097
Tortoise's courtship
has been slow and steady,

537
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:10,267
but he has finally been accepted.

538
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:14,104
[grunting]

539
01:29:37,794 --> 01:29:41,882
Once again, the water hole
will be a lifeline for them all.

540
01:29:50,557 --> 01:29:53,435
[trumpeting]

541
01:30:00,484 --> 01:30:03,779
For Wewe, there is no place like home.

542
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:10,953
And there is nothing quite like
having a new friend to share it with.

543
01:30:25,759 --> 01:30:28,762
Great droughts bring great rains.

544
01:30:30,264 --> 01:30:34,309
And the kingdom's flush of new growth
draws in other families

545
01:30:34,393 --> 01:30:36,854
in a way that hasn't happened for decades.

546
01:30:44,403 --> 01:30:47,239
[low rumbling]

547
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:53,871
[trumpeting]

548
01:30:53,954 --> 01:30:58,625
For a few days,
they form a super-herd, 1,000 strong.

549
01:30:59,418 --> 01:31:02,713
The largest gathering of their kind
on the planet.

550
01:31:09,928 --> 01:31:12,389
[trumpeting]

551
01:31:24,985 --> 01:31:26,403
[squeals]

552
01:31:28,614 --> 01:31:30,032
[trumpets]

553
01:31:32,326 --> 01:31:35,454
The journey has brought
Wewe and Princess together

554
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:39,166
and has been the first step
in acquiring the knowledge

555
01:31:39,249 --> 01:31:41,251
that will help them through their lives.

556
01:31:44,296 --> 01:31:46,465
There will be more droughts to face,

557
01:31:47,591 --> 01:31:51,803
but Athena's family will never forget
the extraordinary matriarch

558
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:55,641
who led them out... and brought them home.

559
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:24,127
Only a handful
of such giant tuskers remain.

560
01:32:29,883 --> 01:32:34,596
Today, this small corner of the continent
still belongs to them.

561
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:42,354
It reminds us of how it once was...

562
01:32:45,148 --> 01:32:48,193
when the whole of Africa was theirs.

563
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:44,208
[chorus vocalizing]
